Determine if the initial segment type is small, equal, or large.

Moving from a head section towards a tail section and then toward another head section or maybe tail section...there is an exact location where it is possible to determine if the section will be a head or a tail without going through the entire section.

>ht_determinant = y + offset - (tailSegSz * flipflop)

small ht_determinant = ht_determinant
medium ht_determinant = ht_determinant + tailSegSz
large ht_determinant = ht_determinant + tailSegSz*2, use to determine if it is a line?
