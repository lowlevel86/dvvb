There are 5 line modeling states:<BR>
</H4>
<ul>
  <li>0 known segments are found, headSz and tailSegSz are unknown (only for initialization)</li>
  <li>1 known segment is found, headSz and tailSegSz are unknown</li>
  <li>1 known segment is found, only tailSegSz is known</li>
  <li>2 known segments are found, headSz and tailSegSz are unknown, tailSz is unknown</li>
  <li>2 known segments are found, headSz and tailSegSz are unknown, tailSz is known</li>
</ul>
<BR>
After the last state, tailSz will be the new known segment. As the raster line is modeled, it will loop through 4 states. tailSz will equal either headSz or tailSegSz. tailSz plus or minus priorTailSegSz will equal either headSz or tailSegSz, whichever one has not been assigned.
